# 导言
如果像塞拉斯（Sellars, 1962）所说的那样，哲学是为了“理解事物如何在尽可能广泛的意义上相互关联”的一种尝试，那么哲学不应该忽视技术。当代社会的紧密互联，很大程度上是靠了技术。技术不单作为一种经济力量而重要，也作为一种文化力量而重要。事实上，在过去的两个世纪里，随着技术哲学逐步成为一门学科，它最关心的是技术对社会与文化的意义和影响，而非技术本身。米切姆（Mitcham，1994）将这种技术哲学称为“人文技术哲学”，因为它既接受了“人文先于技术”的观点，又与人文学科(和一些社会科学)的整体观点相一致。直到最近，技术哲学的一个分支才发展起来，它关注技术本身，并以理解这些对象——设计和造物（广义地，包括人工的过程和系统）的实践，以及事物创生的本相——为鹄的。这个哲学分支寻求与科学哲学以及现代分析哲学传统中的其他几个领域——如行动哲学、决策哲学——的连续性，而非与人文社科的连续性。

本条目始于一个简短的历史概述，然后介绍现代分析技术哲学所关注的主题。接下来是技术的社会和伦理方面的讨论，同时涉及一些人文技术哲学所关注的问题。这份双重介绍将技术发展视为一个『源自工程实践并受其指导的进程』的结果，它遵循技术标准实施有限的社会控制。而技术实践对社会的影响，也只能源于有限可控的过程。

The entry starts with a brief historical overview, then continues with a presentation of the themes on which modern analytic philosophy of technology focuses. This is followed by a discussion of the societal and ethical aspects of technology, in which some of the concerns of humanities philosophy of technology are addressed. This twofold presentation takes into consideration the development of technology as the outcome of a process originating within and guided by the practice of engineering, by standards on which only limited societal control is exercised, as well as the consequences for society of the implementation of the technology so created, which result from processes upon which only limited control can be exercised.

以及如此创造的技术的实施对社会造成的后果，这些后果来自于有限的社会控制。
# 技术哲学史
## 古希腊技术哲学

对技术的哲思和哲学本身一样古老。最古的证言来自古希腊。我们能考证出四个突出的主题。最早的主题是，科技师法自然、模仿自然 (Plato, Laws X 899a ff.)。例如，根据德谟克利特(Democritus)的说法，筑屋起初是模仿燕子筑巢而发明的，而织布起初是模仿蜘蛛织网而发明的(Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 154)。或许，对于自然的师表角色，现存最古的记述就是来自赫拉克利特(Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 112)。亚里士多德通过复读德谟克利特来提及这个传统，但他不主张技术只能模仿自然，“通常而言，技艺(technè)时而及自然之未逮，时而模仿自然” (Physics II.8, 199a15; 也参看 Physics II.2, 还有 Schummer 2001 以及SEP关于认知和技术的讨论)。

Philosophical reflection on technology is about as old as philosophy itself. Our oldest testimony is from ancient Greece. There are four prominent themes. One early theme is the thesis that technology learns from or imitates nature (Plato, Laws X 899a ff.). According to Democritus, for example, house-building and weaving were first invented by imitating swallows and spiders building their nests and nets, respectively (Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 154). Perhaps the oldest extant source for the exemplary role of nature is Heraclitus (Diels 1903 and Freeman 1948: 112). Aristotle referred to this tradition by repeating Democritus’ examples, but he did not maintain that technology can only imitate nature: “generally technè in some cases completes what nature cannot bring to a finish, and in others imitates nature” (Physics II.8, 199a15; see also Physics II.2, and see Schummer 2001 and this encyclopedia’s entry on episteme and techne for discussion).


第二个论述的主题是，人工制品之于自然事物，有着原则上的本体论差别。据亚里士多德(Aristotle Physics II.1)所论，前者有其生成和运动的内在原理；而后者，就其本身而言，只是缘于外因——人类灵魂中的目的和形式——而产生的。自然产物(动物及动物的部位、植物和四要素(译者注：冷、热、干、湿))通过内在的目的因运动、生长、变化和再生；它们被自然的目的所驱使。另一方面，人工制品不能自主地再生产。倘若没有人类的关心和干预，它们会在一段时间后消失，失去其人工形态，并分解成(自然)材料。例如，如果木床被掩埋，它会分解成泥土，或者通过生芽而恢复其植物性。

A second theme is the thesis that there is a fundamental ontological distinction between natural things and artifacts. According to Aristotle (Physics II.1), the former have their principles of generation and motion inside, whereas the latter, insofar as they are artifacts, are generated only by outward causes, namely human aims and forms in the human soul. Natural products (animals and their parts, plants, and the four elements) move, grow, change, and reproduce themselves by inner final causes; they are driven by purposes of nature. Artifacts, on the other hand, cannot reproduce themselves. Without human care and intervention, they vanish after some time by losing their artificial forms and decomposing into (natural) materials. For instance, if a wooden bed is buried, it decomposes to earth or changes back into its botanical nature by putting forth a shoot.


人造产品和天然物质之间存在根本区别的论点产生了持久的影响。在中世纪，阿维森纳（Avicenna）批评炼金术，理由是它永远不能产生“真正的”物质(Briffault 1930: 147)。即使在今天，仍然有人持这种论调，例如，“天然维生素C和合成维生素C之间是有区别的”。第2.5节将介绍现代对这一主题的讨论。


The thesis that there is a fundamental difference between man-made products and natural substances has had a long-lasting influence. In the Middle Ages, Avicenna criticized alchemy on the ground that it can never produce ‘genuine’ substances (Briffault 1930: 147). Even today, some still maintain that there is a difference between, for example, natural and synthetic vitamin C. The modern discussion of this theme is taken up in Section 2.5.

我们可以把亚里士多德的四因学说——质料因、形式因、动力因和目的因——看作早期技术哲学的第三个贡献。亚里士多德以房屋和雕像等技术造物来解释这一学说(Physics II.3)。在现代有关人工制品形而上学的讨论中，四因学说仍然在场。例如，对『功能』概念的讨论，集中在其内在的目的论——“目的因”——特性，以及它在生物学应用中面临的困难。而臭名昭著的『忒修斯之船』案例——参见SEP中有关物质构成(material constitution)、含时同一性(identity over time)、相对同一性(relative identity)和类别(sortals)的条目——被霍布斯引入现代哲学，作为个体化原则(principles of individuation)，表现出物质统一和形式统一之间的冲突。这种冲突被许多人视为人工制品的特征。大卫•威金斯(David Wiggins,1980: 89)甚至将其视为艺术品的定义性特征。


Aristotle’s doctrine of the four causes—material, formal, efficient and final—can be regarded as a third early contribution to the philosophy of technology. Aristotle explained this doctrine by referring to technical artifacts such as houses and statues (Physics II.3). The four causes are still very much present in modern discussions related to the metaphysics of artifacts. Discussions of the notion of function, for example, focus on its inherent teleological or ‘final’ character and the difficulties this presents to its use in biology. And the notorious case of the ship of Theseus—see this encyclopedia’s entries on material constitution, identity over time, relative identity, and sortals—was introduced in modern philosophy by Hobbes as showing a conflict between unity of matter and unity of form as principles of individuation. This conflict is seen by many as characteristic of artifacts. David Wiggins (1980: 89) takes it even to be the defining characteristic of artifacts.

第四点值得提及的是柏拉图(Plato)和亚里士多德对技术意象的广泛运用。柏拉图在他的《蒂迈厄斯（Demiurge）》中，将世界描述为工匠——造物主——的杰作。他对创世细节的描述充满了来自木工、编织、陶瓷、冶金和农业技术的意象。亚里士多德用艺术和工艺间的比较来说明目的因怎样在自然过程中发挥作用。尽管柏拉图和亚里士多德并不欣赏工匠的生活方式，认为他们沉溺于职业和以自由个人的身份谋生的需求，他们发现，为了表达对宇宙之理性设计的信念，技术意象不可或缺(Lloyd 1973: 61)。


A fourth point that deserves mentioning is the extensive employment of technological images by Plato and Aristotle. In his Timaeus, Plato described the world as the work of an Artisan, the Demiurge. His account of the details of creation is full of images drawn from carpentry, weaving, ceramics, metallurgy, and agricultural technology. Aristotle used comparisons drawn from the arts and crafts to illustrate how final causes are at work in natural processes. 

Despite their negative appreciation of the life led by artisans, who they considered too much occupied by the concerns of their profession and the need to earn a living to qualify as free individuals, both Plato and Aristotle found technological imagery indispensable for expressing their belief in the rational design of the universe (Lloyd 1973: 61).




## 古希腊以后的人文技术哲学

在罗马帝国和中世纪时期，虽然技术大有发展，它在哲学上的倒影却显得滞后。而那些综合性著作，诸如维特鲁威(Vitruvius)的论建筑(De architectura,公元前1世纪)和阿格里科拉(Agricola)的论矿冶(De re metallica, 1556年)，则更关注技术的实用方面，而很少在乎哲学。

1.2 Later Developments; Humanities Philosophy of Technology
Although there was much technological progress in the Roman empire and during the Middle Ages, philosophical reflection on technology did not grow at a corresponding rate. Comprehensive works such as Vitruvius’ De architectura (first century BC) and Agricola’s De re metallica (1556) paid much attention to practical aspects of technology but little to philosophy.

经院哲学领域却涌现出对机械艺术的欣赏。通常的观点认为，机械艺术先天且有限地模仿自然。在12世纪中期左右，当炼金术被引入拉丁西方时，这种观点受到了挑战。一些炼金术作家，比如罗吉尔·培根(Roger Bacon)，质疑说：“人类艺术，即便通过模仿学习自然，也能够成功地复制自然产物，甚至超过它们”(Newman 2004)。最终，一种技术哲学产生了。在这种哲学中，人工艺术被提升到欣赏的层次。直到文艺复兴时期，这种欣赏的层次才出现在其他作品中。然而，在十三世纪的最后三十年，历史见证了宗教权威对炼金术愈发升级的敌意，最终，这种敌意在异端审判官尼古拉斯·埃梅里克(Nicholas Eymeric)于1936年发表的著作《反炼金术的谴责》(denunciation Contra alchymistas)中达到顶峰(Newman 2004)。

In the realm of scholastic philosophy, there was an emergent appreciation for the mechanical arts. They were generally considered to be born of—and limited to—the mimicry of nature. This view was challenged when alchemy was introduced in the Latin West around the mid-twelfth century. Some alchemical writers such as Roger Bacon were willing to argue that human art, even if learned by imitating natural processes, could successfully reproduce natural products or even surpass them (Newman 2004). The result was a philosophy of technology in which human art was raised to a level of appreciation not found in other writings until the Renaissance. However, the last three decades of the thirteenth century witnessed an increasingly hostile attitude by religious authorities toward alchemy that culminated eventually in the denunciation Contra alchymistas, written by the inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric in 1396 (Newman 2004).

文艺复兴引起了更强烈的对人类及其造物——包括技术——的欣赏。作为结果，对技术及其社会影响的哲思也随之增加。弗兰西斯·培根(Francis Bacon)通常被认为是第一个提出这种思考的现代作家。在其幻想小说《新亚特兰蒂斯》(New Atlantis，1627年)中，他所表达的观点是极其积极的。这种正面的态度一直持续到19世纪，包括工业革命的前半个世纪。

The Renaissance led to a greater appreciation of human beings and their creative efforts, including technology. As a result, philosophical reflection on technology and its impact on society increased. Francis Bacon is generally regarded as the first modern author to put forward such reflection. His view, expressed in his fantasy New Atlantis (1627), was overwhelmingly positive. This positive attitude lasted well into the nineteenth century, incorporating the first half-century of the industrial revolution.

例如，卡尔·马克思(Karl Marx)并没有因为资产阶级生产方式的恶行而谴责蒸汽机或纺织厂；他相信，为了通向未来更幸福的社会主义和共产主义阶段，持续的技术创新是必要的步骤(参见比伯(Bimber 1990)关于『在马克思的历史理论中技术所起的作用』的不同观点的讨论，以及范德波尔(Van der Pot 1985[1994/2004])『对于技术发展的评价的』广泛的历史综述)。

For example, Karl Marx did not condemn the steam engine or the spinning mill for the vices of the bourgeois mode of production; he believed that ongoing technological innovation were necessary steps toward the more blissful stages of socialism and communism of the future (see Bimber 1990 for a discussion of different views on the role of technology in Marx’s theory of historical development, and see Van der Pot 1985 [1994/2004] for an extensive historical overview of appreciations of the development of technology).

在工业革命影响下，塞缪尔·巴特勒(Samuel Butler)所著的《埃尔维翁》(Erewhon, 1872)和达尔文(Darwin)所著的《物种起源》(On the Origin of Species,1859)标志着技术之作为一种社会文化现象的评价的转折点。巴特勒的书描述了一个虚构的国家，这个国家禁绝机器，保有或试图建造机器均为死罪。这里的国民已经接受了这样一种观点——持续的技术进步或将导致机器的“种族”，这样的种族将取代人类而成为地球主宰。

A turning point in the appreciation of technology as a socio-cultural phenomenon is marked by Samuel Butler’s Erewhon (1872), written under the influence of the Industrial Revolution, and Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859). Butler’s book gave an account of a fictional country where all machines are banned and the possession of a machine or the attempt to build one is a capital crime. The people of this country had become convinced by an argument that ongoing technical improvements are likely to lead to a ‘race’ of machines that will replace mankind as the dominant species on earth.

在19世纪的最后25年和20世纪的大部分时间里，一种批判的态度主导了对技术的哲思。绝大多数这种态度的代表人物，领受的是人文社科的教育，实际上不具备对工程实践的第一手知识。培根(Bacon)写了大量有关科学方法的文章，并亲自进行物理实验；而巴特勒，作为教士，缺乏这样的第一手知识。恩斯特·卡普(Ernst Kapp)是语言和历史学家，他在《技术哲学》(Eine Philosophie der Technik, 1877[2018])中首先使用“技术哲学(philosophy of technology)”一词。在二十世纪，主要的技术批判及其文化批判者都是哲学博学家，如马丁·海德格尔(Martin Heidegger 1954[1977])、汉斯·乔纳斯(Hans Jonas 1979[1984])、阿诺德·格伦(Arnold Gehlen 1957[1980])、冈瑟·安德斯(Günther Anders 1956)和安德鲁·芬伯格(Andrew Feenberg 1999)。其他人则具有另一门人文社科的背景，例如刘易斯·芒福德（Lewis Mumford，1934）具有文学批评和社会研究背景，雅克·埃勒（Jacques Ellul，1954 [1964]）具有法学背景， 兰登·温纳（Langdon Winner，1977，1980，1983）具有政治学背景，阿尔伯特·博格曼(Albert Borgmann，1984）具有文学研究背景。 他们一派的技术哲学著作被卡尔·米切姆（Mitcham 1994）称为“人文技术哲学”，因其出发点是人文社科，而非技术实践，且因这条进路认同 “人文先于技术”（1994：39），因为技术始于人类的目标和价值。

During the last quarter of the nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century a critical attitude predominated in philosophical reflection on technology. The representatives of this attitude were, overwhelmingly, schooled in the humanities or the social sciences and had virtually no first-hand knowledge of engineering practice. Whereas Bacon wrote extensively on the method of science and conducted physical experiments himself, Butler, being a clergyman, lacked such first-hand knowledge. Ernst Kapp, who was the first to use the term ‘philosophy of technology’ in his book Eine Philosophie der Technik (1877 [2018]), was a philologist and historian.Most of the authors who wrote critically about technology and its socio-cultural role during the twentieth century were philosophers of a general outlook, such as Martin Heidegger (1954 [1977]), Hans Jonas (1979 [1984]), Arnold Gehlen (1957 [1980]), Günther Anders (1956), and Andrew Feenberg (1999).
 Others had a background in one of the other humanities or in social science, such as literary criticism and social research in the case of Lewis Mumford (1934), law in the case of Jacques Ellul (1954 [1964]), political science in the case of Langdon Winner (1977, 1980, 1983) and literary studies in the case of Albert Borgmann (1984). The form of philosophy of technology constituted by the writings of these and others has been called by Carl Mitcham (1994) “humanities philosophy of technology”, because it takes its point of departure from the social sciences and the humanities rather than from the practice of technology, and it approaches technology accepting “the primacy of the humanities over technologies” (1994: 39), since technology originates from the goals and values of humans.

人文技术哲学家倾向于视技术现象为当然; 他们把技术看成“黑箱”——某个单一的、整体的、无法逃脱的现象。他们对分析和理解这一现象本身不感兴趣，他们的兴趣在于把握技术与道德(乔纳斯 Jonas，格伦 Gehlen)、政治(威纳 Winner)、社会结构(芒福德 Mumford)、人类文化(埃鲁尔 Ellul)、人类状况(汉娜·阿伦特 Hannah Arendt)或形而上学(海德格尔 Heidegger)的关系。在这一点上，这些哲学家几乎都是公开批判技术的：从整体上看，他们倾向于对『技术对人类社会和文化的影响』作出负面的判断，或者至少他们特地考虑技术对人类社会和文化的负面影响。这并不一定意味着技术本身被指控为这些负面发展的主因。特别的，在海德格尔看来，技术在现代社会中的至高地位，更像是某种更基本原因所致的病征，即一种对存在的脑残态度，这种态度持续升腾，已经上升了将近25个世纪。因此，尽管在传统观点中，海德格尔被认为是最重要的技术哲学家之一，但他是否应该归为技术哲学家，其实值得商榷。阿伦特的情况也类似，尤其参看她在《人类境况》(The Human Condition, 1958年)中对技术的讨论，尽管她在人文技术哲学中的地位没有那么突出。

Humanities philosophers of technology tend to take the phenomenon of technology itself largely for granted; they treat it as a ‘black box’, a given, a unitary, monolithic, inescapable phenomenon. Their interest is not so much to analyze and understand this phenomenon itself but to grasp its relations to morality (Jonas, Gehlen), politics (Winner), the structure of society (Mumford), human culture (Ellul), the human condition (Hannah Arendt), or metaphysics (Heidegger). In this, these philosophers are almost all openly critical of technology: all things considered, they tend to have a negative judgment of the way technology has affected human society and culture, or at least they single out for consideration the negative effects of technology on human society and culture. This does not necessarily mean that technology itself is pointed out as the principal cause of these negative developments. In the case of Heidegger, in particular, the paramount position of technology in modern society is rather a symptom of something more fundamental, namely a wrongheaded attitude towards Being which has been on the rise for almost 25 centuries. It is therefore questionable whether Heidegger should be considered as a philosopher of technology, although within the traditional view he is considered to be among the most important ones. Much the same could be said about Arendt, in particular her discussion of technology in The Human Condition (1958), although her position in the canon of humanities philosophy of technology is not as prominent.


可以肯定的是，徒子徒孙们进一步推动了人文技术哲学奠基人的工作——尤其是海德格尔的工作，其仍然是重要的灵感来源——但他们对技术及其对人类生活和文化的意义采取了更为中立而非普遍消极的看法。著名的例子是艾德（1979，1993）和韦贝克（2000 [2005]）。

To be sure, the work of these founding figures of humanities philosophy of technology has been taken further by a second and third generation of scholars—in particular the work of Heidegger remains an important source of inspiration—but who in doing so have adopted a more neutral rather than overall negative view of technology and its meaning for human life and culture. Notable examples are Ihde (1979, 1993) and Verbeek (2000 [2005]).

在其发展过程中，人文技术哲学持续受到社会科学和人文科学发展的影响，而非受到哲学发展(例如，科学哲学、行动哲学、心灵哲学)的影响。尽管这些现象学家或后现象学家，比如艾德（Ihde）及其同侪，似乎对这种今昔哲学的观念扩散兴趣不大，尤其是对『海德格尔在何种程度上可以被视为现象学家』这一难题兴趣不大。特别重要的是20世纪80年代出现的“科学和技术研究”(STS)，它从广泛的社会科学角度研究社会、政治和文化价值观如何影响科学研究和技术创新，以及这些价值观如何反过来影响社会、政治和文化。我们在第3节“技术的伦理和社会方面”中讨论了来自技术的人文哲学的作者，但并不单独和详细地介绍在这个领域中存在的各种各样的观点。Mitcham在1994年出版的书提供了一个很好的概述来详细说明。奥尔森、塞林格和里斯(2008)提供了一系列最近的贡献;Scharff和Dusek(2003[2014])和Kaplan(2004[2009])从这个传统中提出了全面的文本选集。

In its development, humanities philosophy of technology continues to be influenced not so much by developments in philosophy (e.g., philosophy of science, philosophy of action, philosophy of mind) but by developments in the social sciences and humanities. Although, for example, Ihde and those who take their point of departure with him, position their work as phenomenologist or postphenomenologist, there does not seem to be much interest in either the past or the present of this diffuse notion in philosophy, and in particular not much interest in the far from easy question to what extent Heidegger can be considered a phenomenologist. Of particular significance has been the emergence of ‘Science and Technology Studies’ (STS) in the 1980s, which studies from a broad social-scientific perspective how social, political, and cultural values affect scientific research and technological innovation, and how these in turn affect society, politics, and culture. We discuss authors from humanities philosophy of technology in Section 3 on ‘Ethical and Social Aspects of Technology’, but do not present separately and in detail the wide variety of views existing in this field. For a detailed treatment Mitcham’s 1994 book provides an excellent overview. Olsen, Selinger and Riis (2008) offer a collection of more recent contributions; Scharff and Dusek (2003 [2014]) and Kaplan (2004 [2009]) present comprehensive anthologies of texts from this tradition.


## 1.3 技术的模糊含义

1.3 A Basic Ambiguity in the Meaning of Technology

Mitcham对比了“技术的人文哲学”和“技术的工程哲学”，后者指的是由工程师或技术专家发展的哲学观点，“试图……阐明一种技术哲学”(1994:17)。米查姆只讨论了少数几个人作为工程技术哲学家，然而:恩斯特·卡普，彼得·恩格尔迈耶，弗里德里希·德索尔，更简单的雅克·拉菲特，吉尔伯特·西蒙顿，亨德里克·范·里森，胡安·大卫·加西亚·巴卡，R.巴克明斯特·富勒和马里奥·邦吉。然而，这一标签引发了严重的问题:其中一些人很难被归为“工程师或技术专家”，而且“技术哲学”的概念应该如何理解也不是很清楚。作为哲学家，这些作者似乎都是相当孤立的人物，他们的工作几乎没有重叠，他们似乎主要分享缺乏与已建立的哲学学科的“工作关系”。什么样的问题和关注是“技术的工程哲学”这一概念的基础还不是很清楚。系统哲学的一个更大的作用可以使它非常接近人文科技哲学的一些例子，例如雅克·埃勒的工作，那里的分析将是相当相似的，剩下的差异将是态度或欣赏。
Mitcham contrasts ‘humanities philosophy of technology’ to ‘engineering philosophy of technology’, where the latter refers to philosophical views developed by engineers or technologists as “attempts … to elaborate a technological philosophy” (1994: 17). Mitcham discusses only a handful of people as engineering philosophers of technology, however: Ernst Kapp, Peter Engelmeier, Friedrich Dessauer, and much more briefly Jacques Lafitte, Gilbert Simondon, Hendrik van Riessen, Juan David García Bacca, R. Buckminster Fuller and Mario Bunge. The label raises serious questions, however: several of them hardly classify as ‘engineers or technologists’ and it is also not very clear how the notion of ‘a technological philosophy’ should be understood. As philosophers these authors seem all to be rather isolated figures, whose work shows little overlap and who seem to be sharing mainly the absence of a ‘working relation’ with established philosophical disciplines. It is not so clear what sort of questions and concerns underlie the notion of ‘engineering philosophy of technology’. A larger role for systematic philosophy could bring it quite close to some examples of humanities philosophy of technology, for instance the work of Jacques Ellul, where the analyses would be rather similar and the remaining differences would be ones of attitude or appreciation.

在下一节中，我们将更详细地讨论一种技术哲学形式，我们认为它目前占据着替代人文技术哲学的位置。它出现于20世纪60年代，并在过去15到20年里获得了发展势头。技术哲学的这种形式，可以称为“分析的”，主要关注的不是技术与社会的关系，而是技术本身。它明确地没有把技术视为一个“黑盒子”，而是作为一种应该被详细研究的现象。它可能并不把技术全部看作是一种实践，而是基于实践的东西，基本上是工程实践。它分析了这种实践，它的目标，它的概念和它的方法，并将它的发现与哲学的各种主题联系起来。

In the next section we discuss in more detail a form of philosophy of technology that we consider to occupy, currently, the position of alternative to the humanities philosophy of technology. It emerged in the 1960s and gained momentum in the past fifteen to twenty years. This form of the philosophy of technology, which may be called ‘analytic’, is not primarily concerned with the relations between technology and society but with technology itself. It expressly does not look upon technology as a ‘black box’ but as a phenomenon that should be studied in detail. It regards technology perhaps not in its entirety as a practice but as something grounded in a practice, basically the practice of engineering. It analyses this practice, its goals, its concepts and its methods, and it relates its findings to various themes from philosophy.


分析技术哲学把技术作为一种由工程师支撑的实践来关注，就像科学哲学把科学实践作为科学家支撑一样，分析技术哲学可以被认为等同于工程哲学。事实上，许多与设计有关的问题，在下文第2.3节和第2.4节中讨论，可以被挑出来作为形成工程哲学的主题问题。然而，在2.5节中讨论的形而上学问题不能，分析技术哲学因此比工程哲学广泛得多。《技术与工程科学哲学》(Meijers 2009)的标题，是一个广泛的最新综述，包含了对下一节讨论的所有主题的贡献，表达了技术与工程不一致的观点。然而，这并不是说，该书提供了一个清晰的概念，使技术不同于工程，或超过工程。事实上，人文技术哲学与分析技术哲学并存，反映了技术概念的一种基本的模糊性，一直以来的哲学工作都未能澄清这种模糊性。


In focusing on technology as a practice sustained by engineers, similar to the way philosophy of science focuses on the practice of science as sustained by scientists, analytic philosophy of technology could be thought to amount to the philosophy of engineering. Indeed many of the issues related to design, discussed below in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, could be singled out as forming the subject matter of the philosophy of engineering. The metaphysical issues discussed in Section 2.5 could not, however, and analytic philosophy of technology is therefore significantly broader than philosophy of engineering. The very title of Philosophy of Technology and Engineering Sciences (Meijers 2009), an extensive up-to-date overview, which contains contributions to all of the topics treated in the next section, expresses the view that technology and engineering do not coincide. Which is not to say, however, that the book offers a clear conception of what makes technology different from engineering, or more than engineering. In fact, the existence of humanities philosophy of technology and analytic philosophy of technology next to each other reflects a basic ambiguity in the notion of technology that the philosophical work that has been going on has not succeeded in clarifying.


技术可以说具有两个“核心”或“向度”，可称为工具性和生产力。工具性涵盖了人类通过工具干涉世界，以有目的和巧妙的方式，使用事物来控制自己的生活和环境的全部努力。生产力涵盖了人类为使新事物得以存在而进行的全部努力，这些事物可以以可控和聪明的方式完成某些事情。然而，对于工具性的研究，原则上是否由我们首先制造用于控制我们的生活和环境的东西是无关紧要的；如果我们能够以某种方式依靠自然物体来始终为我们的目的服务，那么对工具性及其对我们生活的后果的分析就不一定会受到影响。同样，为了分析人工制品的制造过程，以及如何理解人工制品的概念以及应运而生的新事物，在很大程度上与人类生活，文化和社会的变化无关由于实际产生的伪像。显然，迄今为止，人文技术哲学被工具性向度所吸引，而分析技术哲学则主要被生产力向度所吸引。但是，技术作为现代社会的基本现象之一，即使不是最基本的现象，也显然是由以两个核心为中心并涉及两个核心的过程构成的。然而，事实证明，很难找到一种全面的方法来充分处理技术的这两个方面之间的相互作用，这无疑部分是由于与这两种传统及其各自的焦点相关的哲学取向和方法上的巨大差异。可以说，改善这种状况是整个技术哲学领域面临的最紧迫的挑战，因为两个方向的延续导致他们各自的生活首先威胁到其作为一门学科的统一性和连贯性。尽管它具有中心性和紧迫性，但这里指出的歧义似乎在文学中几乎没有直接面对。 Lawson（2008，2017）以及Franssen和Koller（2016）解决了这个问题。


Technology can be said to have two ‘cores’ or ‘dimensions’, which can be referred to as instrumentality and productivity. Instrumentality covers the totality of human endeavours to control their lives and their environments by interfering with the world in an instrumental way, by using things in a purposeful and clever way. Productivity covers the totality of human endeavours to brings new things into existence that can do certain things in a controlled and clever way. For the study of instrumentality, however, it is in principle irrelevant whether or not the things that are made use of in controlling our lives and environments have been made by us first; if we somehow could rely on natural objects to always be available to serve our purposes, the analysis of instrumentality and its consequences for how we live our lives would not necessarily be affected. Likewise, for the analysis of what is involved in the making of artifacts, and how the notion of artifact and of something new being brought into existence are to be understood, it is to a large extent irrelevant how human life, culture and society are changed as a result of the artifacts that are in fact produced. Clearly, humanities philosophy of technology has until now been more attracted by the instrumentality core whereas analytic philosophy of technology has mainly gone for the productivity core. But technology as one of the basic phenomena of modern society, if not the most basic one, clearly is constituted by the processes centering on and involving both cores. It has proved difficult, however, to come to an overarching approach in which the interaction between these two dimensions of technology are adequately dealt with—no doubt partly due to the great differences in philosophical orientation and methodology associated with the two traditions and their separate foci. To improve this situation is arguably the most urgent challenge that the field of philosophy of technology as a whole is facing, since the continuation of the two orientations leading their separate lives threatens its unity and coherence as a discipline in the first place. Notwithstanding its centrality and urgency, the ambiguity noted here seems hardly to be confronted directly in the literature. It is addressed by Lawson (2008, 2017) and by Franssen and Koller (2016).


在下一部分介绍了技术和工程学的哲学相关性的主要问题之后，我们将在第三部分和最后一部分中讨论技术对实践社会所带来的问题和挑战。

After presenting the major issues of philosophical relevance in technology and engineering that are studied by analytic philosophers of technology in the next section, we discuss the problems and challenges that technology poses for the society in which it is practiced in the third and final section.
